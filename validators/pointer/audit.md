# Pointer bank audit status

The bank repairs do not constitute the independent audit in `docs/validators.md` section 12.7. The bank lands after component PR 692. Ten executor iterations and the independent audit run after that component merges.

| Check | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| blind pilot | pending | Requires merged pointer reader PR 692 and ten executor iterations. |
| cheater | pending | Maintainer empty/constant and targeted mutation regressions are recorded separately; a fresh independent helper still audits the merged component. |
| cause review | pending | Author-declared cause tags and composite exclusions are not a reviewed distinct-fix count. |
| planted bugs | pending | Requires independent mutations of the merged real component. |

The seeds 1–20 plus hidden baseline is recorded in `baseline.json` and the journal after the repaired bank runs. No forecast or merge-gate pass is claimed from this baseline.
